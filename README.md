## Repos that helped me to setup this project:

- **[ReScript template with snowpack](https://github.com/jihchi/app-template-rescript-react)**
- **[ReScript react starter kit](https://github.com/bloodyowl/rescript-react-starter-kit)**

## Available Scripts

### yarn

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.
